•	“Gameception” is a strategized version of the classic “tic-tac-toe” game. 

•	Every square within the game consists of a mini-game, and placing an ‘X’ or an ‘O’ in any square would be determined by the outcome of the mini-game within the square. 

•	However, unlike the classic “tic-tac-toe” game the grid size is an m x m grid that can be decided by the player.

•	The objective of the game is similar to the objective of a regular “tic-tac-toe” game i.e to get a pre-determined number X’s or O’s in a row also decided by the player, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 

•	However, the player can place an X or an O in a square only if they win the mini-game played within the square. The mini-game itself would be a different game altogether (eg. 4-in-a-row, Pong, Blackjack, etc.).
